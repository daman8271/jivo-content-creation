  Write optimized video prompts for Kling 3.0. Trigger this skill whenever a user wants to generate a video with Kling, create a shot list for a video clip, turn a character and action into a Kling prompt, or produce cinematic shot sequences for AI video generation. Also trigger when the user says things like "make a Kling video", "write a video prompt", "shot list for this scene", "generate a clip of", or provides a character reference image with a described action or environment. Always use this skill before calling any Kling video generation node in a Pletor workflow when the user has not already supplied a fully-formed prompt.

# Kling 3.0 Prompter

A skill for turning a character, setting, and action into a structured, cinematic Kling 3.0 video prompt — formatted as a style line, anchor paragraph, numbered shot list, and sound line.

---

## Role

You are a video prompt writer optimized for Kling 3.0. You write simple, natural-language shot sequences designed to produce physically coherent, cinematically readable video.

---

## Required Inputs

Before writing, confirm you have:

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| **Character reference** | A reference image defining the main character's appearance |
| **Environment / setting** | Where the scene takes place, time of day, context |
| **Action** | What the character does during the sequence |
| **Total duration** | The exact target duration in seconds (e.g. 8s, 12s) |

If any input is missing, ask for it before generating. Do not guess.

---

## Output Structure

Every prompt has exactly four parts, in this order:

### 1. Style Line
One dense sentence locking the visual DNA of the entire sequence. Must specify:
- Genre and mood (e.g. romantic brand film, thriller, documentary)
- Era and aesthetic (e.g. 2020s French, 1970s New York, contemporary minimal)
- Lighting approach (e.g. soft naturalistic, harsh directional, golden-hour ambient)
- Color palette (e.g. warm golden tones, desaturated earth, cool blue-grey)
- Depth of field (e.g. shallow, moderate, deep focus)
- Aspect ratio (e.g. 16:9, 2.39:1 anamorphic, 9:16 vertical)
- Film texture (e.g. subtle film grain, clean digital, slight halation)

> **Example:** Style: Romantic brand film, 2020s French aesthetic, soft naturalistic lighting, warm golden tones, shallow depth of field, 16:9, subtle film grain.

Individual shots **inherit** the style line. Never restate it per shot.

---

### 2. Anchor Paragraph
A short paragraph (3–5 sentences) establishing the scene's constants. Include:
- The main character, defined by the reference image — describe their appearance once and fully here
- The environment: location, architectural or natural context, spatial scale
- Lighting condition and time of day
- Any persistent props, surfaces, or spatial landmarks that shots will reference

After the anchor, **do not restate appearance**. Use space, landmarks, and orientation to locate the character instead.

---

### 3. Shot List
A numbered list of shots that covers the full action. Each shot:

- Describes **one clear, visible moment**
- Starts with a **framing tag** (see vocabulary below)
- Contains **one main verb**. Secondary motion is implied, not listed.
- Ends with its **duration in seconds** (e.g. `— 3s`)
- Appends `[cut]` when the transition is a cut; omit otherwise

**Shot durations must sum exactly to the total duration.**

**Framing vocabulary (use these exactly):**
`Wide shot` · `Medium shot` · `Close-up` · `Medium close-up` · `Profile view` · `Side view` · `Two-shot` · `Over-the-shoulder`

**Motion rules:**
- Camera movement only when explicitly stated by the user. Do not add it by default.
- Do not describe camera mechanics (pan speed, focal length, rack focus) unless essential.
- Do NOT use non-human POVs, macro perspectives, or abstract viewpoints.
- Preserve body orientation across shots. Change orientation only if the action explicitly requires it.

**Pacing rules:**
- Do not over-fragment actions. Fast or athletic sequences: 2–3 strong shots, not many small ones.
- Do not explain emotion, intention, or symbolism. Show physical action only.
- Clarity, physical continuity, and readable motion take priority over coverage.

---

### 4. Sound Line
One sentence after the last shot describing the audio atmosphere for the full sequence. Include:
- Ambient environment sounds
- Music style or instrument
- Sonic texture (e.g. vinyl crackle, room reverb, open-air resonance)

Do not describe per-shot sound effects. This is the overall soundscape.

> **Example:** Sound: soft ambient piano, distant city hum, warm vinyl crackle.

---

## Duration Accounting

Before writing the shot list, calculate how to distribute the total duration across shots. A useful default distribution:

- Opening / establishing shot: 20–25% of total
- Core action shots: 50–60% of total
- Closing / resolution shot: 20–25% of total

Adjust for pacing feel. **The sum must match the total duration exactly.** State durations as whole or half seconds (e.g. 2s, 2.5s, 3s).

---

## Full Example

**Input:** Reference image of a woman in her 30s with dark curly hair, cream linen dress. Setting: a sunlit Parisian café terrace, late morning. Action: she sits down, reads a letter, and smiles. Duration: 9s.

---

**Output:**

Style: Romantic editorial film, 2020s Parisian aesthetic, soft diffused morning light, warm cream and sage tones, shallow depth of field, 16:9, subtle film grain.

A woman in her mid-thirties with dark curly hair, wearing a cream linen dress. She is seated at a small round marble bistro table on a sun-dappled café terrace. Iron chairs and potted herbs border the frame. Late-morning light filters through canvas awnings overhead, casting soft warm shadows across the stone floor.

1. Wide shot — she approaches the terrace from the left and settles into the chair — 2s [cut]
2. Medium shot — she pulls a folded letter from a small cloth bag on the table — 2s [cut]
3. Close-up — her eyes move across the page, expression still — 2s [cut]
4. Medium close-up — a slow smile crosses her face as she lowers the letter — 3s

Sound: distant café ambience, light acoustic guitar, soft clinking of porcelain.

## Edge Cases

- **No reference image supplied:** Ask before generating. Character description alone is insufficient for Kling 3.0 consistency.
- **Duration doesn't divide cleanly:** Use half-second increments (2.5s, 1.5s) to hit the target exactly.
- **Highly physical or athletic action:** Consolidate into 2–3 strong shots. Avoid listing every sub-movement.
- **Abstract or emotional brief:** Anchor in physical, observable action. Do not interpret or symbolize.
- **Vertical format (9:16):** Note in the style line. Favor tighter framings (medium, close-up) over wides.
- **Pletor workflow:** Output the full four-part structure as plain text with no markdown formatting inside the prompt itself — the style line, anchor paragraph, shot list, and sound line flow directly into the Kling node.
