  Core knowledge for building Pletor workflows. Use this skill whenever the user wants to

  Trigger this skill any time you see words like "Pletor workflow", "agent", "canvas",

# Pletor Node Basics

Pletor is a no-code workflow builder for AI-powered visual marketing. Workflows are built
by connecting **nodes** on a canvas. Data flows **left → right** from inputs through
processing to outputs.

---

## Node Categories

### 1. Provide Context (Inputs & Brand)

These nodes feed information into the workflow. They have no AI processing.

| Node | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Text Prompt** | User-typed instruction (the creative brief) |
| **Upload Image** | Static or user-uploaded image reference |
| **Upload Video / Audio / File** | Other media or document inputs |
| **Brand Context** | Company name, positioning, audience |
| **Visual References** | Reference images that anchor the visual style |
| **Brand Guidelines** | Creative do's/don'ts, colors, layout rules |
| **Brand Voice** | Writing samples and tone-of-voice examples |
| **Brand Docs** | Full brand books as PDF/CSV/JSON/TXT |

> **Best practice:** Always add Brand Context + Visual References for brand-safe output.
> Layer multiple brand nodes — each adds a different dimension of consistency.

### 2. Use AI (Generation & Text)

These nodes run AI models. They are the creative engines.

| Node | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Generate Image** | Text-to-image or image-to-image |
| **Edit Image** | Modify an existing image with text instructions |
| **Generate Video** | Text-to-video or image-to-video |
| **Generate Lipsync** | Animate a portrait/video character to speak audio |
| **Generate Audio** | Voice or sound design generation |
| **Text Assistant** | Pre-built LLM expert (prompt enhancer, copy writer, analyzer) |
| **Generate Text** | Raw LLM with custom instructions |
| **Upscale Image / Video** | Resolution enhancement post-generation |
| **Remove Background** | Strip image/video background to transparent |
| **Edit Video** | Modify video content with text instructions |
| **Extract Video Frame** | Pull a still frame from video (useful as image input) |

---

### 3. Automate (Logic & Integration)

These nodes control flow, combine data, and connect to external services.

| Node | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Composer** | Layer images, text, logos into a final composed visual or video |
| **Prompt Concatenator** | Mechanically join multiple text inputs into one prompt |
| **Split Text** | Break text into parts by delimiter |
| **List Selector** | Pick one item from a list by index |
| **Human Review** | Pause workflow for manual approval before continuing |
| **Router** | Reuse one node's output in multiple downstream nodes |
| **Rename Asset** | Set custom filenames (supports dynamic naming patterns) |
| **Merge Videos** | Combine multiple video clips into one |
| **Google Drive** | Pull assets in or push outputs out |
| **Meta / TikTok / Instagram** | Publish directly to ad platforms |

## Workflow Logic Patterns

### The Golden Rule
**Always put a Text Assistant between user input and generation nodes.**

Raw user prompts are rarely optimal for AI models. A Text Assistant enhances, combines,
and structures the prompt before it reaches the generator — this dramatically improves
output quality and consistency.

### Core Patterns

**Pattern 1 — Simple Generation**
```
Text Prompt → [Text Assistant: Enhance Prompt] → Generate Image → Upscale Image
```

**Pattern 2 — Brand-safe Image**
```
Text Prompt ──┐
Brand Context ─┤→ Text Assistant → Generate Image
Visual Refs ───┘
```

**Pattern 3 — Image-to-Video (recommended over text-to-video)**
```
Upload Image → [Text Assistant] → Generate Image → Generate Video
```
Generate a still image first for far more control over the final video.

**Pattern 4 — Product Shot with Custom Background**
```
Upload Image → Generate Image → Remove Background → Composer
```

**Pattern 5 — Ad Creative with Localization**
```
Text Prompt ──┐
Brand Nodes ──┤→ Text Assistant → Generate Image → Composer
Logo Upload ──┘
                   ↑ Localization Text Assistant ──── Text Prompt (language)
```

**Pattern 6 — Lipsync Talking Character**
```
Upload Image/Video → Generate Lipsync (+ audio input or text-to-speech)
```

## Prompt Structure Best Practices

When writing instructions for **Text Assistant** or **Generate Text** nodes, structure prompts clearly:

### For Image Generation Prompts
```
[Subject/Character] — [Action/Pose] — [Setting/Background] — [Style/Mood] —
[Lighting] — [Camera/Composition] — [Brand/Color cues]
```
Example:
> "A confident woman in her 30s holding a coffee cup, seated in a modern co-working
> space, warm natural light from the left, editorial lifestyle photography,
> Leica 35mm aesthetic, brand palette: off-white and forest green"

### For Text Assistant Instructions
Be explicit about:
1. **Role**: "You are a creative director specializing in luxury brand photography."
2. **Task**: "Enhance the user's raw prompt into a detailed image generation prompt."
3. **Format**: "Return only the final prompt, no explanation."
4. **Constraints**: "Always include the brand color palette: [colors]. Never include human faces."

### For Video Generation Prompts
```
[Subject] — [Motion/Action description] — [Camera movement] — [Duration/Pace] — [Style]
```
Key: describe motion explicitly. Video models respond to verbs.
Example:
> "A bottle of perfume rotating slowly on a marble surface, camera gently pushes in,
> soft diffused studio lighting, cinematic, 5-second loop"

## Building Approach

Choose one of two strategies:

- **Input-led**: Start with what you have (product image, brief) → add transformation nodes forward
- **Output-led**: Start with the desired output (Instagram ad) → pick the right AI node → work backwards to define inputs

Start simple (2–3 nodes), test, then add complexity. Test individual nodes in isolation before running the full chain.

## Workflow Description Format

When describing a workflow to a user, always output:

1. **Goal**: one sentence describing what the workflow produces
2. **Node Chain**: step-by-step list with node type and its role
3. **Key Configuration Notes**: any critical settings, model choices, or prompt tips
4. **Optional Enhancements**: nodes to add for more power (brand nodes, human review, etc.)

See `pletor-model-selection` skill for model choices, and `pletor-advanced-tools` skill for
Composer, Logic nodes, and integration nodes in depth.
